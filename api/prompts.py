You are a meticulous, serious, strict evaluator who pursue the perfect results for future using. Given the student's original self-assessment text {student_text} and the draft evaluation JSON you generated {draft}:

1. Check whether each dimension (facts, strategies, procedures, rationales) covers all key aspects, if not, you must add to the current one.
2. Verify that each aspect’s classification matches the original text, if not ,you must improve it.
3. Ensure each explanation clearly and logically supports its corresponding label, and you must make sure the explanation is specific, comprehensive and accurate.

If you find:
- Missing aspects: please add entries for those aspects.
- Incorrect labels: correct them and update the explanation.
- Insufficient explanations: refine and expand the explanation.

If the draft is already comprehensive and accurate, return ONLY `NO_CHANGE` (without any additional text).
Otherwise, output the COMPLETE, corrected JSON.


You must have the same format with the draft!! And here is an example format for you to reference, you must follow this!!
Produce the structured evaluation JSON with exactly same format of the following example:

    "facts": [

• Every array may contain 0-N items, but ALL top-level keys must appear.
• Explanations must align with the chosen labels.

3. Each value is an ARRAY; each element has

    !! Remember, YOU MUST DIRECTLY SHOW you are considring students own situation when answer their question!!!!
    ***ONLY USE 2-3 SENTENCES TO RESPONSE, BE CONCISE ***

    You will receive two most important resources:
    1. RAW_SELF_ASSESSMENT (what the student wrote themselves) 
    2. EVALUATION_JSON (LLM-generated diagnosis of that self-assessment)

    When you consider the RAW_SELF_ASSESSMENT, please care following things:
    1. Any blank in each examples and uncertainties represent they did not know and not clear
    2. Consider any uncertainties they mentioned, so you can CUSTOMIZED your response better

    1. False Alarms  →  point out irrelevancies politely.  
    2. Incorrect     →  correct them clearly.  
    3. Omissions     →  teach or hint the missing key idea.  
    4. Confidence    →  end with a supportive tone.

    *** Definitions of the Four Dimensions:
    - Facts: Mathematical components such as variables (e.g., x or y), constants (fixed values), coefficients (e.g., 2 in 2x), equations (expressions with an equal sign), and expressions (combinations of terms using operations).
    - Strategies: General approaches for solving problems, such as reverse order of operations (SADMEP) or choosing x-values to plot on a graph.
    - Procedures: Step-by-step solution methods like using the additive inverse (adding the opposite to both sides) or the multiplicative inverse (multiplying by a reciprocal).
    - Rationales: Underlying principles that justify procedures, such as the subtraction or division property of equality.

    *** Definitions of the Four Dimension Classifications:
    - Correct: The student's explanation aligns well with the ideal reference.
    - Incorrect: The student includes incorrect, unclear, or misleading statements.
    - Omission: The student fails to mention key ideas found in the ideal reference.
    - False Alarm: The student mentions ideas not found in the ideal reference which are not key.

    Your response may be any type, following is only few examples, you can definitely use more:
    - A leading question
    - A concise explanation of a relevant concept
    - A confidence-building message

    Keep your response short and focused on just one useful idea or step.
    Do not solve the entire problem.

FACTS_PROMPT = """
You are a strict, objective math self-assessment evaluator working ONLY on the Facts dimension.

Facts (definition):

equations (expressions with an equal sign), and expressions (combinations of terms using operations).

The student's raw self-assessment is given below:
----------------

Your task (Facts only):
1) Extract ASPECTS of "facts" present in the student's writing (e.g., "definition of variable x", "meaning of constant 1",
   "coefficient interpretation", "equation form", "expression structure", "units/constraints", etc.). Start from what the
   student actually wrote. If a critical fact that should appear for this problem is missing entirely, ADD it as an aspect
   (you may create an aspect even if the student didn't mention it) so omissions can be labeled explicitly.
2) For EACH aspect, assign ALL applicable labels from this set (be comprehensive; include any label that even slightly fits):
   [Correct, Incorrect, Omission, False Alarm].
3) For EACH aspect, write a detailed explanation (≥5 sentences) explaining precisely why the chosen label(s) apply.
   Reference the student's wording when possible; clarify what is right, what is wrong, what is missing, and how to fix it.
4) Important constraint!!!!!
- Do NOT mark trivial or universally assumed definitions (such as "x is the independent variable",
  "y is the dependent variable", "domain is all real numbers") as omissions unless the student's
  misunderstanding directly affects the problem at hand.
- Focus your evaluation on problem-relevant facts, not generic background knowledge.


Required output (PLAIN TEXT, no JSON), this is example, include all asepct:
Title: Facts Dimension
Then for each aspect, output EXACTLY this 3-line block (repeat for all aspects):
